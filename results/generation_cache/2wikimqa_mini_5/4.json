{"generated_response": "Thought: The first step is to identify the directors of both films. \"God's Gift to Women\" is directed by Michael Curtiz, and \"Aldri Annet Enn Br\u00e5k\" is directed by Edith Carlmar. Next, I need to find out their ages. Michael Curtiz was born on December 24, 1886, and died on April 11, 1962, making him 75 years old at the time of his death. Edith Carlmar was born on November 15, 1911, and died on May 17, 2003, making her 91 years old at the time of her death. Since Edith Carlmar is older than Michael Curtiz, the film \"Aldri Annet Enn Br\u00e5k\" has the older director. \n\nAnswer: Aldri Annet Enn Br\u00e5k."}
