{"generated_response": "Thought: The first step is to identify the directors of both films. Charlie Day is the director of El Tonto, and Robert North Bradbury is the director of The Heart of Doreon. Next, I need to find out when each director was born. Charlie Day was born on February 9, 1976, and Robert North Bradbury's birth date is not provided in the retrieved context. However, I do have the birth date of Elliot Silverstein, who is not related to either film but is mentioned in the context. Since I cannot find the birth date of Robert North Bradbury, I cannot directly compare the two directors' birth dates. However, I can conclude that Charlie Day was born in 1976, which is likely much later than Robert North Bradbury, who directed a film in 1921. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Robert North Bradbury was born before Charlie Day.\n\nAnswer: The Heart Of Doreon."}
